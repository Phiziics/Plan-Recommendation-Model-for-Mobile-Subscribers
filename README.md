# Project-7 DAtE: April 24, 2024
Machine Learning
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify subscribers based on their mobile phone usage data and recommend one of Megaline's newer plans, Smart or Ultra. The goal is to analyze the behavior patterns of Megaline's subscribers and identify which plan (Smart or Ultra) best suits their needs.

By achieving this, Megaline can offer personalized plan recommendations to its subscribers, leading to an improved customer experience and potential increases in customer satisfaction and retention. The classification model will be evaluated for its performance on a test dataset, with the objective of reaching a minimum accuracy of 0.75.

In summary, the project aims to:

Develop a classification model that can accurately predict whether a subscriber should switch to the Smart or Ultra plan based on their mobile usage data.
Analyze and understand the behavior patterns of Megaline's subscribers.
Enhance customer satisfaction and retention through personalized plan recommendations that align with each subscriber's unique usage profile.
